# Elm Cycle Challenge
Just playing with the exercises from [Cycle JS Fundamentals](https://egghead.io/series/cycle-js-fundamentals), all apps done in Elm, using the Elm architecture and displaying them all in the same page.
Check the [Original cycle version](https://github.com/gustavoguichard/cycle-studies) to compare.

## Start

`elm package install`

`elm reactor`

Go to `localhost:8000`
